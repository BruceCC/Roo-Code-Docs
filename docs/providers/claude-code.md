# Claude Code Provider

:::info Setup Instructions
Before using the Claude Code provider, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1.  **Install Claude CLI**: Download and install the official command-line tool from [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup).
2.  **Authenticate**: Run `claude` in your terminal to start the application. Once the application is running, type `/login` to sign in to your Anthropic account. This step is required to grant Roo Code access to your Claude subscription.
3.  **Verify Setup**: Confirm the CLI is working by running `claude --version`. This ensures that Roo Code can find and use the executable.
4.  **Configure in Roo Code**:
    *   Go to Roo Code settings and select **"Claude Code"** as your API provider.
    *   If you installed the CLI in a custom location, set the **"Claude Code Path"** to the full executable path (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/claude`). Otherwise, you can leave it blank.
    *   Choose your desired model from the list of available options.

Once configured, Roo Code will use your local Claude CLI installation to interact with Anthropic's models, leveraging your existing subscription.
:::

The Claude Code provider allows you to use Anthropic's Claude models through their official CLI (Command Line Interface) instead of the web API. This provides direct access to your Claude Max subscription right from Roo Code.

:::warning API Key Precedence
The Claude Code provider executes the `claude` command-line tool, which is built on Anthropic's official SDKs. These SDKs are designed to automatically use the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication if it is set.

If you have this environment variable defined, it will take precedence over the CLI's internal login (`/login`). Roo Code will reflect that an API key is being used, which is the expected behavior of the underlying `claude` tool.

## Key Features
- **Direct CLI Access**: Uses Anthropic's official Claude CLI tool for model interactions.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Full support for Claude's thinking mode and reasoning capabilities.
- **Cost Transparency**: Shows exact usage costs as reported by the CLI.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Works with your existing Claude CLI setup.

---

## Why Use This Provider

- **No API Keys**: Uses your existing Claude CLI authentication.
- **Cost Benefits**: Leverage CLI subscription rates and transparent cost reporting.
- **Latest Features**: Access new Claude capabilities as they're released in the CLI.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Full support for Claude's thinking modes.

## How it Works

The Claude Code provider works by:

1. **Running Commands**: Executes the `claude` CLI command with your prompts.
2. **Processing Output**: Handles the CLI's JSON output in chunks with advanced parsing.
3. **Handling Reasoning**: Captures and displays Claude's thinking process when available.
4. **Tracking Usage**: Reports token usage and costs as provided by the CLI.

The provider integrates with Roo Code's interface, giving you the same experience as other providers while using the Claude CLI under the hood.

## Configuration

You only need to configure one optional setting:

### **Claude Code Path**
- **Setting**: `claudeCodePath`
- **Description**: Path to your Claude CLI executable.
- **Default**: `claude` (assumes it's in your system PATH).
- **When to change**: If you installed Claude CLI in a custom location.

**Example custom paths:**
- macOS/Linux: `/usr/local/bin/claude` or `~/bin/claude`

---

## Supported Models

The Claude Code provider supports these Claude models:

- **Claude Sonnet 4** (latest, recommended)
- **Claude Opus 4** (most capable)
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku** (fast responses)

The specific models available depend on your Claude CLI subscription and plan.

## Common Questions

**"Do I need a Claude API key for this provider?"**
- No, the primary authentication method is the CLI's built-in `/login` command.
- However, if the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your system, the Claude CLI will use it for authentication, and it will take precedence.

**"How do I install the Claude CLI?"**
- Visit [Anthropic's CLI documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) for installation instructions
- The CLI handles its own authentication and setup

**"Why would I use this instead of the regular Anthropic provider?"**
- Potential cost benefits depending on your subscription

**"What if the CLI isn't in my PATH?"**
- Set a custom path in the Claude Code Path setting
- Point to the full path where you installed the CLI
