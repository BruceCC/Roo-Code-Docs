# Roo Code 3.25 Release Notes

## 3.25.0 (2025-07-29)

This release brings powerful new capabilities to Roo Code, including custom slash commands for workflow automation, enhanced Gemini models with web access, comprehensive image support, and seamless message queueing for uninterrupted conversations.

### Custom Slash Commands

Create your own slash commands to automate repetitive workflows ([#6263](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6263), [#6286](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6286), [#6333](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6333), [#6336](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6336), [#6327](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6327)):

- **File-Based Commands**: Place markdown files in `.roo/commands/` to create custom commands instantly
- **Management UI**: New interface for creating, editing, and deleting commands with built-in fuzzy search
- **Argument Hints**: Commands display helpful hints about required arguments as you type
- **Rich Descriptions**: Add metadata and descriptions to make commands self-documenting

Turn complex workflows into simple commands like `/deploy` or `/review` for faster development.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Slash Commands Guide](/features/slash-commands) for detailed usage instructions.

### Message Queueing

Continue typing while Roo processes your requests with the new message queueing system ([#6167](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6167)):

- **Non-Blocking Input**: Type and send messages even while Roo is processing previous requests
- **Sequential Processing**: Messages are queued and processed in the order they were sent
- **Visual Feedback**: See queued messages clearly displayed in the interface
- **Maintained Context**: Each message maintains proper context from the conversation

Keeps your workflow smooth when you have multiple quick questions or corrections.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Message Queueing Guide](/features/message-queueing) for detailed information.

### Image Support for read_file Tool

The [`read_file`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/read-file) tool now supports reading and analyzing images (thanks samhvw8!) ([#5172](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5172)):

- **Multiple Formats**: Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, ICO, and TIFF
- **OCR Capabilities**: Extract text from screenshots and scanned documents
- **Batch Processing**: Read multiple images from a folder with descriptions
- **Simple Integration**: Works just like reading text files - no special configuration needed

Useful for analyzing UI mockups, debugging screenshot errors, or extracting code from images.

### Gemini Tools: URL Context and Google Search

Gemini models can now access web content and perform Google searches for more accurate, up-to-date responses (thanks HahaBill!) ([#5959](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5959)):

- **URL Context**: Directly analyze web pages, documentation, and online resources
- **Google Search Grounding**: Get fact-checked responses based on current search results
- **User Control**: Enable or disable web features based on your privacy preferences
- **Real-Time Information**: Access the latest documentation and best practices

Perfect for researching new libraries, verifying solutions, or getting current API information.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Gemini Provider Guide](/providers/gemini) for setup and usage instructions.

### Context-Aware Prompt Enhancement

Prompt enhancement now uses your conversation history for better suggestions (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#6343](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6343)):

- **Smarter Suggestions**: Enhancement considers your last 10 messages to generate more relevant prompts
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Context awareness prevents the AI from making unfounded suggestions
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use a separate API configuration for enhancement operations
- **Toggle Control**: Enable or disable task history inclusion based on your needs

To enable this feature: Settings â†’ Prompts tab â†’ Select "ENHANCE" â†’ Check "Include task history in enhancement" for better context.

> **ðŸ“š Documentation**: See [Prompt Enhancement Guide](/features/enhance-prompt) for configuration options.
