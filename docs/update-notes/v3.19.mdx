# Roo Code 3.19 Release Notes (2025-06-02)

This release series focuses on streamlining the user interface with intelligent context condensing enabled by default, improved mode organization, enhanced file protection, experimental multi-file reading capabilities, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

## Intelligent Context Condensing Now Default
We've enabled intelligent content condensing by default and relocated the condense button for easier access:

- **Default Activation**: Intelligent context condensing is now enabled out of the box for all users
- **Improved Button Placement**: Moved the condense button out of the expanded task menu for quicker access
- **Smart Error Handling**: The system now skips condensing and shows clear error messages if context grows during the condensing process

*Intelligent Context Condensing configuration options: automatic triggering toggle, threshold slider, API configuration selection, and custom prompt customization.*

For comprehensive details about this feature, see the main [Intelligent Context Condensing documentation](/features/intelligent-context-condensing).

## Streamlined Mode Organization
We've reorganized the interface for better workflow organization:

- **Modes Tab**: Transformed the Prompts tab into a dedicated Modes tab for clearer navigation
- **Settings Relocation**: Moved support prompts to Settings for better organization
- **Cleaner Interface**: Simplified the main interface by grouping related features more logically

Navigate between different modes and prompts more intuitively.

## Multi-File Reading (Experimental)
We've introduced an experimental feature for handling large codebases more efficiently:

- **Batch File Processing**: Read up to 100 files in a single operation for comprehensive code analysis
- **Performance Control**: Adjustable concurrent file read limits to optimize for your system
- **Smart Permission Management**: Streamlined approval process for multi-file operations
- **Efficiency Boost**: Dramatically reduces the time needed to analyze multiple related files

This experimental feature transforms how Roo Code understands and works with your entire codebase at once (thanks samhvw8!).

## Enterprise-Ready VPC Endpoint Support
We've added crucial enterprise security features for [AWS Bedrock](/providers/bedrock) users:

- **Secure Corporate Access**: Configure custom VPC endpoints to keep all LLM transactions within your firewall
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple checkbox and text field to enable VPC endpoint usage
- **Compliance Ready**: Meet your organization's security policies while using powerful AI models
- **Flexible Control**: Toggle VPC endpoints on/off as needed with settings persistence

Enterprise customers can now use Roo Code with AWS Bedrock while maintaining complete network security (thanks kcwhite!). See the [AWS Bedrock configuration guide](/providers/bedrock#configuration-in-roo-code) for setup instructions.

## QOL Improvements

*   **MCP Server Instructions Support**: Added support for server instructions in MCP configuration (thanks qingyuan1109!) ([#4210](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4210))
*   **Optimized Chat Layout and Styles**: Fine-tuned the layout and styling of chat messages for improved readability (thanks zhangtony239!) ([#4205](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4205))
*   **MCP Server Connection Reliability**: Fixed SSE connection issue for MCP servers using web-based transports (thanks taylorwilsdon!) ([#4251](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4251))

## Bug Fixes

*   **Major Memory Leak Fixes**: Multiple memory leaks resolved for improved stability and performance:
    - **ChatView**: Fixed leaks from unmanaged async operations and setTimeouts (thanks kiwina!)
    - **WorkspaceTracker**: FileSystemWatcher and other disposables are now properly cleaned up (thanks kiwina!)
    - **RooTips**: setTimeout is now cleared to prevent state updates on unmounted components (thanks kiwina!)
    - **RooIgnoreController**: FileSystemWatcher leak resolved by ensuring Task.dispose() is always called (thanks kiwina!)
    - **Clipboard**: useCopyToClipboard now clears setTimeout to avoid memory leaks (thanks kiwina!)
    - **ClineProvider**: Instance cleanup improved to prevent lingering resources (thanks xyOz-dev!)
*   **Directory Mention Protection**: Fixed [`@directory`](/basic-usage/context-mentions) not respecting [`.rooignore`](/features/rooignore) files (thanks xyOz-dev!)
*   **Tool File Protection**: Added [`rooignore`](/features/rooignore) checking for [`insert_content`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/insert-content) and [`search_and_replace`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/search-and-replace) tools
*   **Memory Leak Fix**: Resolved memory leak in ChatView by stabilizing callback props (thanks samhvw8!)
*   **Empty File Creation**: Fixed [`write_to_file`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/write-to-file) to properly create empty files when content is empty (thanks Ruakij!)
*   **Chat Input Stability**: Fixed chat input clearing during running tasks (thanks xyOz-dev!)
*   **MCP Server Authentication**: Fixed SSE header passing to correctly authenticate with remote MCP servers
*   **AWS Bedrock Conversations**: Resolved context condensing error that required conversations to start with user messages
*   **Terminal UTF-8 Encoding**: Fixed encoding errors when running Ruby/CocoaPods commands (thanks mr-ryan-james!)
*   **Sidebar Context Menus**: Resolved empty menu items by properly setting sidebar name (thanks chrarnoldus!)
*   **Documentation Links**: Fixed broken CONTRIBUTING.md link in feature request template (thanks cannuri!)
*   **Prevent Full File Dump on User Edit**: Resolved an issue where editing a file before saving a proposed modification could dump the entire file content into the context. This fix prevents context bloat, maintains model focus, and reduces costs ([#4219](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4219), [#3654](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/3654)) (thanks KJ7LNW!).
*   **Correct OpenAI-Compatible API Key Label**: The label for OpenAI-compatible API keys in settings now correctly reads "API Key" instead of "OpenAI API Key" for better clarity ([#4191](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4191)).
*   **Prevent Invalid Markers in `apply_diff` REPLACE**: Added validation to ensure `:start_line:` and `:end_line:` markers are not incorrectly included in the `REPLACE` section of `apply_diff` operations, improving robustness ([#4015](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4015)) (thanks KJ7LNW!).
*   **Fix Virtuoso Footer Re-rendering**: Addressed an issue where the Virtuoso component's footer would continuously re-render, improving UI performance ([#4209](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4209)) (thanks kiwina!).
*   **Release Memory in `apply_diff`**: Optimized memory usage in the `apply_diff` tool by explicitly releasing the original content buffer after use, helping to prevent potential memory leaks ([#4193](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4193)) (thanks xyOz-dev!).
*   **Fix Directory Link Handling in Markdown**: Enhanced how directory links in markdown (e.g., `[some/directory/](some/directory/)`) are handled, ensuring they correctly open in the Explorer view ([#3690](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/3690)) (thanks KJ7LNW!).
*   **Typo Fixes**: Corrected various typos in comments and tool use prompts ([#4220](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4220), [#4095](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/4095)) (thanks mrubens, noritaka1166!).
