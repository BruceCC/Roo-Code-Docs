# Dashboard

The Roo Code Cloud dashboard provides a central location to manage your account, view task history, monitor usage analytics, and control remote workspaces.

## Accessing the Dashboard

There are two ways to access your Roo Code Cloud dashboard:

### Method 1: From the Roo Code Plugin

Once logged in, click the **cloud icon** <Codicon name="cloud" /> in the top right corner of the Roo Code plugin, then click **Visit Roo Code Cloud**.

### Method 2: Direct Web Access

Navigate directly to the Roo Code Cloud web application:

**https://app.roocode.com/**

This allows you to access your dashboard from any web browser, even when not using the Roo Code extension.

## Dashboard Pages

### Home Page

The Home page combines Roomote Control and Tasks History in a single view.
