# Roomote Control

Roomote Control (also known as Remote Control) enables real-time monitoring and control of Roo Code tasks running in your VS Code extension directly from the Roo Code Cloud web interface.

## What is Roomote Control?

Roomote Control creates a bidirectional connection between your local VS Code extension and Roo Code Cloud, allowing you to:

- **Follow along in real-time** with task activity from your IDE
- **Monitor tasks** running in your IDE with live updates
- **Control tasks remotely** ([Pro feature](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month) - start, stop, interact)
- **View live progress** with streaming updates

## Key Features

### Real-time Workspace Connection

- Automatically detects open VS Code workspaces
- Shows connection status with green <Codicon name="wifi" /> indicator
- Displays workspace path and project name
- Maintains persistent connection during tasks

### Task Monitoring

- Live streaming of task messages and progress
- Visual indicators for task status (running, idle, interactive)

### Remote Task Control

- **Chat Interface** - Interact with the chatbox just as though you were in your IDE (includes message queuing, attaching images, changing modes, switching providers, and all standard chat features)
- **Start New Tasks** - Launch tasks in any connected workspace
- **Stop Running Tasks** - Safely terminate active tasks
- **Task Switching** - Navigate between tasks including resuming tasks that have been stopped or closed

:::note Pro Feature Required for Remote Control
While basic monitoring is available to all users, remote control capabilities (starting, stopping, and interacting with tasks remotely) require a [Pro subscription ($20/month)](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions#pro-plan-20month).
