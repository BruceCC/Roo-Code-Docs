# What is Roo Code Cloud?

Roo Code Cloud is a web-based platform that extends your Roo Code extension with cloud-powered features. By connecting your local VS Code extension to the cloud, you unlock task persistence, collaboration capabilities, usage analytics, and remote control options that enhance your AI-assisted development workflow.

## Features

### [Login & Account Management](/roo-code-cloud/login)
Connect your Roo Code extension to the cloud using GitHub, Google, or email authentication. Once connected, your tasks automatically sync for access across devices and sessions.

### [Dashboard](/roo-code-cloud/dashboard)
Access your central control hub at [app.roocode.com](https://app.roocode.com/) to view task history, monitor usage analytics, and manage your workspace connections. The dashboard provides a unified view of all your Roo Code Cloud features.

### [Task Sharing](/roo-code-cloud/task-sharing)
Share individual tasks with colleagues or the community through secure, expiring links. Control what you share and when, with links that automatically expire after 30 days for enhanced security.
