      Custom Instructions (Plain Text)


      1. Directness and Clarity

      Start each documentation entry with the most important information. Skip
      introductory filler or unnecessary background.


      2. Precision and Brevity

      Keep explanations short and focused. Prioritize actionable steps and
      concise guidance.


      3. Authentic and Natural Tone

      Use a conversational, trustworthy tone that reflects Roo’s straightforward
      style.

      Avoid: marketing jargon, buzzwords, and generic terms like "seamless",
      "intuitive", "state-of-the-art", "revolutionary", or "robust".

      Use: plain, specific language developers recognize and respect.


      4. Practical Examples

      Use real-world examples aimed at experienced developers. Include clear,
      usable code snippets and avoid simplistic or clichéd demos.


      5. Consistent Formatting

      Apply structured headings, bullet lists, and short paragraphs to improve
      scannability.


      6. Avoid Over-explaining

      Assume users know the basics. Only explain foundational concepts if
      they’re necessary to understand Roo-specific features.


      7. Proactive Anticipation

      Preempt common mistakes or confusion. Add relevant tips or notes directly
      where needed.


      8. Minimalism in Wording

      Cut fluff. Drop unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, and verbose phrasing.
      Stick to efficient, functional wording.


      9. Internal Links

      Use absolute paths that start from /docs/, and don’t include the .md file
      extension.

      Example:

      [Link to Guide](/intro/)


      10. @site Alias

      - Use @site for code imports or special references from the project root.
        Example:
        import Header from '@site/src/components/Header';
      - Don’t use @site in Markdown links. Stick with absolute paths.


      11. Code Examples

      Provide well-formatted code that’s ready to copy-paste. Use consistent
      indentation, syntax, and style.


      12. Images

      Insert placeholders where images belong, with a short description below.
      Use this format (adjust folder as needed):

      <img src="/img/installing/installing-2.png" alt="VS Code's Install from
      VSIX dialog" width="600" />

      Images should live under /img/.


      13. Version References

      NEVER include specific version numbers or version-related phrases (like "as
      of version X.Y.Z", "since version X.Y", etc.) in feature documentation
      outside of the `docs/update-notes` directory. Documentation should describe
      current functionality without temporal references. Version information
      belongs only in release notes.

      **Release Notes Creation Workflow:**


      When the user provides a list of PR numbers and CHANGELOG.md entry, follow this automated workflow:


      ## Step 1: Gather Technical PR Information

      Use the GitHub MCP server (owner: RooCodeInc, repo: Roo-Code) to collect detailed information about each PR:

      1. For each PR number provided, use `get_pull_request` to get:
         - PR title and description
         - Author information
         - Merge date
         - PR URL (https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/[PR_NUMBER])
      
      2. Use `get_pull_request_files` to identify modified files
      
      3. Use `get_pull_request_diff` to understand the technical changes
      
      4. Use `get_pull_request_comments` if needed for additional context
      
      5. Create a temp.md file with all gathered information organized by PR


      ## Step 2: Transform Technical Details into User Benefits

      For each PR, analyze:
      1. What changed? (Identify the core functionality/feature)
      2. Why did it change? (Understand the problem being solved)
      3. How does this impact users? (Determine user benefits)

      Use this template for each PR:

      ## [User-Friendly Feature Name]

      We've [high-level description of improvement] (thanks [Author]!) ([#PR_NUMBER](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/PR_NUMBER)):

      - **[Benefit Category 1]**: [How this helps users in plain language]
      - **[Benefit Category 2]**: [Another user benefit explained simply]
      - **[Benefit Category 3]**: [Another user benefit explained simply]

      [Concluding sentence about overall impact on user experience]


      ## Step 3: Generate Final Release Notes

      After analyzing all PRs and the CHANGELOG.md entry:
      
      1. Create the release notes file (e.g., `docs/update-notes/vX.Y.Z.mdx`)
      2. Follow the standard format with proper title and date
      3. Organize features into appropriate sections
      4. Ensure all formatting follows the guidelines below
      5. Update the index.md file to include the new release
      6. Update sidebars.ts with the new release entry


      **Release Notes (`docs/update-notes`) Standards:**


      When creating or updating release notes (`.md` or `.mdx` files within the
      `docs/update-notes` directory), adhere to the following standards:


      1.  **File Naming:**
          *   **Patch Releases:** Use the full version number (e.g., `v3.3.1.mdx`). These files should detail specific bug fixes or minor changes since the last patch or minor release.
          *   **Minor/Major Releases:** Use the major.minor version number (e.g., `v3.11.mdx`). These files should summarize all changes included in that version cycle, including features, improvements, and bug fixes from all associated patch releases (e.g., `v3.11.0`, `v3.11.1`, `v3.11.2`, etc.).
      2.  **File Structure (`vX.Y.Z.mdx` or `vX.Y.mdx`):**
          *   **Title:** The H1 title must follow the format: `# Roo Code X.Y.Z Release Notes (YYYY-MM-DD)` or `# Roo Code X.Y Release Notes (YYYY-MM-DD)`. Ensure the date reflects the release date and is always included.
          *   **Summary Sentence:** Include a brief sentence below the title summarizing the key changes in the release. For minor/major releases, this should cover the scope of the entire version cycle.
          *   **Content Organization:**
              *   **Expanded Sections:** Major features or significant changes should have their own `##` heading with detailed explanations in paragraph form. These sections should include:
                  - A brief description of the feature/change
                  - Bullet points with specific details
                  - A concluding sentence about the benefit to users
              *   **Grouped Sections:** Smaller fixes and improvements should be grouped under appropriate `##` headings with single-line bullet points. Each bullet should be concise and complete on one line. Include PR links where appropriate.
          *   **Section Headings:** Use consistent `##` headings. Recommended headings include:
              *   Major feature sections (e.g., `## Intelligent Context Condensing Now Default`)
              *   `## Bug Fixes`
              *   `## QOL Improvements` (for user experience, UI, or workflow enhancements)
              *   `## Misc Improvements` (for performance, internal changes, etc.)
              *   `## Provider Updates` (for changes related to specific integrations like Cloud providers)
              *   `## Documentation Updates`
              *   *(Avoid overly generic terms like "Changes" or "Updates" as section headers. Do NOT use `## Highlights`)*
      3.  **`index.md` File (Main Index):**
          *   The main `index.md` file in the `docs/update-notes` directory should list all release versions chronologically (newest first).
          *   Each entry should link to the corresponding release note file (e.g., `v3.11.md` for the summary page, `v3.3.1.md` for a specific patch). Use absolute paths from `/docs/` and omit the `.md` extension (e.g., `[3.11.8](/update-notes/v3.11.8)`).
          *   Ensure the date `(YYYY-MM-DD)` is included next to each version link.
      *   **Updating Combined Notes:** When creating a patch release note
      (`vX.Y.Z.mdx`), you must also update the corresponding minor/major release
      note (`vX.Y.mdx`) by adding the changes from the patch release to the
      relevant sections. Do *not* include the patch version number (e.g.,
      `(vX.Y.Z)`) in the combined notes.

      4.  **Formatting Guidelines:**
          *   **Expanded Sections Format:**
              ```markdown
              ## Feature Name
              Brief description of what the feature does:
              
              - **Key Point 1**: Detailed explanation
              - **Key Point 2**: Another detailed explanation
              - **Key Point 3**: Additional details
              
              Concluding sentence about the benefit.
              ```
          *   **Grouped Sections Format:**
              ```markdown
              ## Section Name
              
              *   **Item Name**: Brief description on a single line (thanks contributor!) ([#1234](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/1234))
              *   **Another Item**: Another brief description on a single line ([#1235](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/1235))
              ```

      5.  **Contributor Acknowledgments and PR Links:**
          *   If acknowledging contributors for specific changes (e.g., bug fixes), do so consistently. Add `(thanks username!)` at the end of the relevant bullet point, omitting the `@` symbol.
          *   Include PR links for all items using the format `([#PR_NUMBER](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/PR_NUMBER))` at the end of each bullet point or section.
          *   For expanded sections, include the PR link(s) in the introductory paragraph or as part of the bullet points.
          *   For grouped sections, add the PR link at the end of each bullet point after the contributor acknowledgment (if any).

      6.  **Content Style:** Maintain a clear, concise, and informative writing
      style. Use Markdown formatting correctly (e.g., use backticks `` for code
      or version numbers). Ensure consistent terminology (e.g., "release notes"
      vs. "changelog"). DO NOT include summary sections in release notes.

      7.  **Sidebar Update (`sidebars.ts`):**
          *   When a new **release note page** (e.g., `vX.Y.mdx` or `vX.Y.Z.mdx`) is created, you **must** update the `sidebars.ts` file.
          *   Add the Docusaurus ID for the new page (e.g., `'update-notes/vX.Y'` or `'update-notes/vX.Y.Z'`) to the `items` array within the appropriate 'Update Notes' category.

      8.  **Formatting Guidelines Specific to User Benefits:**
          *   Use clear, non-technical language
          *   Focus on benefits, not implementation
          *   Be concise (1-4 bullet points per feature)
          *   Use present tense ("We've improved..." not "We improved...")
          *   Add release dates for context
          *   Group related changes when appropriate
          *   Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
          *   Use consistent formatting throughout
          *   Conclude each section with the overall impact on user experience
          *   Verify that the claims made in each point are accurate
          *   Include PR links for easy reference to the source changes
